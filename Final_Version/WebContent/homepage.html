		<p>This web application allows users to rent sporting equipment to enhance active consumers so minimize the time, financing, <br> 
		and hassle of purchasing equipment. The users therefore don't have to fully commit to purchasing these items and can simply <br> 
		rent them for their convenience. We will be operating solely online and our equipment will be shipped from our warehouse. <br> 
		This is convenient for users who want to try out a lifestyle or sport without the commitment. Users create an account and <br> 
		simply rent sport bundles or individual equipment. Consumers may think that if they want to go camping one time during a year,<br> 
		there should be a service where they can simply rent that equipment to try out camping. This is where our business comes in <br> 
		and gives consumers that option. </p>
